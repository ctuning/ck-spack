    """CLAPACK is a f2c'ed version of LAPACK.

       The CLAPACK library was built using a Fortran to C conversion utility
    called f2c.  The entire Fortran 77 LAPACK library is run through f2c to
    obtain C code, and then modified to improve readability.  CLAPACK's goal
    is to provide LAPACK for someone who does not have access to a Fortran
    compiler."""
