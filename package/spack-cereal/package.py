    """cereal is a header-only C++11 serialization library. cereal takes
       arbitrary data types and reversibly turns them into different
       representations, such as compact binary encodings, XML, or
       JSON. cereal was designed to be fast, light-weight, and easy to
       extend - it has no external dependencies and can be easily bundled
       with other code or used standalone.
