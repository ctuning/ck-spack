class Kealib(CMakePackage):
    """An HDF5 Based Raster File Format.

    KEALib provides an implementation of the GDAL data model.
    The format supports raster attribute tables, image pyramids,
    meta-data and in-built statistics while also handling very
    large files and compression throughout.

    Based on the HDF5 standard, it also provides a base from which
    other formats can be derived and is a good choice for long
    term data archiving. An independent software library (libkea)
    provides complete access to the KEA image format and a GDAL
    driver allowing KEA images to be used from any GDAL supported software.

    Development work on this project has been funded by Landcare Research.
