class Breakdancer(CMakePackage):
    """BreakDancer-1.3.6, released under GPLv3, is a Cpp package that provides
    genome-wide detection of structural variants from next generation
    paired-end sequencing reads. It includes two complementary programs.
    BreakDancerMax predicts five types of structural variants: insertions,
    deletions, inversions, inter- and intra-chromosomal translocations from
    next-generation short paired-end sequencing reads using read pairs that are
    mapped with unexpected separation distances or orientation.
    BreakDancerMini focuses on detecting small indels (usually between 10bp and
    100bp) using normally mapped read pairs.."""
