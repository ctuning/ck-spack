       neutron transportation simulation code.  It is adapted from a
       similar miniapp provided by Andrew Siegel, whose algorithm is
       described in [1], where only one process in a compute node
       is used, and the compute nodes are divided into memory nodes
       and tracking nodes.    Memory nodes do not participate in particle
       tracking. Obviously, there is a lot of resource waste in this design.
