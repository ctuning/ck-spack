    """This R/Bioconductor package provides an interface between HDF5
    and R. HDF5's main features are the ability to store and access very
    large and/or complex datasets and a wide variety of metadata on mass
    storage (disk) through a completely portable file format. The rhdf5
    package is thus suited for the exchange of large and/or complex
    datasets between R and other software package, and for letting R
    applications work on datasets that are larger than the available RAM."""
