    definition of a keyboard. The extension makes it possible to specify
    clearly and explicitly most aspects of keyboard behaviour on a per-key
    basis, and to track more closely the logical and physical state of a
    keyboard. It also includes a number of keyboard controls designed to
    make keyboards more accessible to people with physical impairments."""
