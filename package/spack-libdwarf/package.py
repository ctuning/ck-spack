    """The DWARF Debugging Information Format is of interest to
       programmers working on compilers and debuggers (and any one
       interested in reading or writing DWARF information). It was
       developed by a committee (known as the PLSIG at the time)
       starting around 1991. Starting around 1991 SGI developed the
       libdwarf and dwarfdump tools for internal use and as part of
       SGI IRIX developer tools. Since that time dwarfdump and
       libdwarf have been shipped (as an executable and archive
       respectively, not source) with every release of the SGI
       MIPS/IRIX C compiler."""
