    WebSocket requests directly from within R. It is primarily intended as a
    building block for other packages, rather than making it particularly easy
    to create complete web applications using httpuv alone. httpuv is built on
    top of the libuv and http-parser C libraries, both of which were developed
    by Joyent, Inc. (See LICENSE file for libuv and http-parser license
