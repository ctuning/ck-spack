class RSnprelate(RPackage):
    """Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are widely used to investigate
       the genetic basis of diseases and traits, but they pose many
       computational challenges. We developed an R package SNPRelate to
       provide a binary format for single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data
       in GWAS utilizing CoreArray Genomic Data Structure (GDS) data files.
       The GDS format offers the efficient operations specifically designed
       for integers with two bits, since a SNP could occupy only two bits.
       SNPRelate is also designed to accelerate two key computations on SNP
       data using parallel computing for multi-core symmetric multiprocessing
       computer architectures: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and
       relatedness analysis using Identity-By-Descent measures. The SNP GDS
       format is also used by the GWASTools package with the support of S4
       classes and generic functions. The extended GDS format is implemented
       in the SeqArray package to support the storage of single nucleotide
       variations (SNVs), insertion/deletion polymorphism (indel) and
       structural variation calls."""
