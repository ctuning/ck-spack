class ROpenssl(RPackage):
    """Bindings to OpenSSL libssl and libcrypto, plus custom SSH pubkey
    parsers. Supports RSA, DSA and EC curves P-256, P-384 and P-521.
    Cryptographic signatures can either be created and verified manually or via
    x509 certificates. AES can be used in cbc, ctr or gcm mode for symmetric
    encryption; RSA for asymmetric (public key) encryption or EC for Diffie
    Hellman. High-level envelope functions combine RSA and AES for encrypting
    arbitrary sized data. Other utilities include key generators, hash
    functions (md5, sha1, sha256, etc), base64 encoder, a secure random number
    generator, and 'bignum' math methods for manually performing crypto
    calculations on large multibyte integers."""
