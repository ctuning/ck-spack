    """Allows for fast, correct, consistent, portable, as well as convenient
    character string/text processing in every locale and any native encoding.
    Owing to the use of the ICU library, the package provides R users with
    platform-independent functions known to Java, Perl, Python, PHP, and Ruby
    programmers. Among available features there are: pattern searching (e.g.,
    with ICU Java-like regular expressions or the Unicode Collation Algorithm),
    random string generation, case mapping, string transliteration,
    concatenation, Unicode normalization, date-time formatting and parsing,
    etc."""
