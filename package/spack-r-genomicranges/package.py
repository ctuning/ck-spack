class RGenomicranges(RPackage):
    """The ability to efficiently represent and manipulate genomic annotations
       and alignments is playing a central role when it comes to analyzing
       high-throughput sequencing data (a.k.a. NGS data). The GenomicRanges
       package defines general purpose containers for storing and manipulating
       genomic intervals and variables defined along a genome. More specialized
       containers for representing and manipulating short alignments against a
       reference genome, or a matrix-like summarization of an experiment, are
       defined in the GenomicAlignments and SummarizedExperiment packages
       respectively. Both packages build on top of the GenomicRanges
       infrastructure."""
