class RBiomart(RPackage):
    """In recent years a wealth of biological data has become available in
       public data repositories. Easy access to these valuable data resources
       and firm integration with data analysis is needed for comprehensive
       bioinformatics data analysis. biomaRt provides an interface to a growing
       collection of databases implementing the BioMart software suite
       (http://www.biomart.org). The package enables retrieval of large amounts
       of data in a uniform way without the need to know the underlying
       database schemas or write complex SQL queries. Examples of BioMart
       databases are Ensembl, COSMIC, Uniprot, HGNC, Gramene, Wormbase and
       dbSNP mapped to Ensembl. These major databases give biomaRt users direct
       access to a diverse set of data and enable a wide range of powerful
       online queries from gene annotation to database mining."""
