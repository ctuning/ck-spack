class RVsn(RPackage):
    """The package implements a method for normalising microarray intensities,
       and works for single- and multiple-color arrays. It can also be used
       for data from other technologies, as long as they have similar format.
       The method uses a robust variant of the maximum-likelihood estimator
       for an additive-multiplicative error model and affine calibration. The
       model incorporates data calibration step (a.k.a. normalization), a
       model for the dependence of the variance on the mean intensity and a
       variance stabilizing data transformation. Differences between
       transformed intensities are analogous to "normalized log-ratios".
       However, in contrast to the latter, their variance is independent of
       the mean, and they are usually more sensitive and specific in detecting
       differential transcription."""
