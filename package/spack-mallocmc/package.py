    """mallocMC: Memory Allocator for Many Core Architectures.

    This project provides a framework for fast memory managers on
    many core accelerators. Currently, it supports NVIDIA GPUs of
    compute capability sm_20 or higher through the ScatterAlloc
    algorithm.

    mallocMC is header-only, but requires a few other C++ libraries
    to be available.
