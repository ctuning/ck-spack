class Mpifileutils(AutotoolsPackage):
    """mpiFileUtils is a suite of MPI-based tools to manage large datasets,
       which may vary from large directory trees to large files.
       High-performance computing users often generate large datasets with
       parallel applications that run with many processes (millions in some
       cases). However those users are then stuck with single-process tools
       like cp and rm to manage their datasets. This suite provides
       MPI-based tools to handle typical jobs like copy, remove, and compare
       for such datasets, providing speedups of up to 20-30x."""
