class Lrzip(Package):
    """A compression utility that excels at compressing large files
    (usually > 10-50 MB). Larger files and/or more free RAM means that the
    utility will be able to more effectively compress your files (ie: faster /
    smaller size), especially if the filesize(s) exceed 100 MB. You can either
    choose to optimise for speed (fast compression / decompression) or size,
    but not both."""
