class Dbus(Package):
    """D-Bus is a message bus system, a simple way for applications to
       talk to one another. D-Bus supplies both a system daemon (for
       events such new hardware device printer queue ) and a
       per-user-login-session daemon (for general IPC needs among user
       applications). Also, the message bus is built on top of a
       general one-to-one message passing framework, which can be used
       by any two applications to communicate directly (without going
       through the message bus daemon)."""
